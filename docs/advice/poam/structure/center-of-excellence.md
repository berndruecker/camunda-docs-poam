## What is a center of excellence (CoE)?

- A group of people
- having expertise in a certain topic
- provide guidance or deliver services, artifacts

A CoE is a dedicated team of experts tasked with diffusing a high demand, specific capability across an organization. In the case of an
Automation CoE, this team is often composed of IT and programming experts aiming to bring process automation to various business units.

The common theme across successful Camunda adaptors is, that the CoE was the game changer for them, unlocking a lot of automation and scaling potential. Without any

Why?
Credability!

The main challenges around a CoE are:

- Get funding to start your CoE
- Scope your CoE and define the operating model
- Provide content and potentially software artifacts
- Make the CoE known in the company and the goto place for all things process orchestration

## Scope of your CoE

- could be tied to process orchestration or a specific vendor
- but most often make more sense to evolve around process automation holistically, owning tools around PO, RPA, low-code, etc...
- This way, one group can also give objective guidance on which tool to use for what problem, overeseeing the differences (instead of the Camunda CoE fighting against the RPA CoE)

## Core activities and artifacts

From Slide (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pr-I8bsrNd5nFKCyHPa-3Z6LQMOFL-PyQUcdUTDLKxc/edit#slide=id.g1ca3328d0e8_1_34)

- Enablement

  - Define relevant skill set (Scoping on relevant skills)
  - Build automation skills (Learning Plans on Camunda Academy; Ad-hoc onsite / virtual trainings; Recurrent sync-up)
  - Create and maintain best practices (Guidelines and best practices tailored on the implementation / need; Reference calls with other Camunda customers; Knowledge base creation and documentation)

- Tooling / Governance

  - Offer process automation tool stack for BPM cycle (Camunda toolstack; Test Tools; CD/CI)
  - Decide technical operations model for Camunda (Platform Plugins; Definition of roles and approval process; Process pipeline
    KPI tracking; Event based processes (Optimize))
  - Manage architecture decisions (Architecture review workshops; Best practices; Tune the engine to improve performances)
  - Provide reusable components/libraries (e.g. element templates, SSO/LDAP integration, ...)(Installation scripts; Custom Plugins
    Process libraries; External workers and connectors)

- Solution delivery

  - Evaluate automation pipeline
  - Implement automation projects (Consulting sessions along the whole BPM cycle)
  - Consult & accompany delivery teams (Support on initial set-up, Constructive feedback for future improvements, KPI analysis and continuous improvement)
  - Orchestrate partners (Coordinate with external partners to staff projects)

- Communication

  - Evangelize automation (Ad-hoc internal events (Lunch & Learn); External event (Camunda Con; Regional Meet-ups); Roadmap presentation, demo)
  - Foster internal communication (Ad-hoc newsletter; Executive Business Review; UX interviews / workshop )
  - Manage Community of Practice (CoP)
    - Events
    - Slack Channels
    - Blogs
  - Speak at external events (Speak at internal events; Emphasize the benefits (fast wins); Speak at external events; Case studies)
  - Case Studies with vendors
  - Vendor contact & license management

- e.g. consulting services, best practices, Guidelines, naming conventions, project templates,
- also operating the platform (PaaS/SaaS)

Step by step:

- Build and publish foundational assets: Then, the organization will need to build an engagement layer for developers and architects alike. This involves building and publishing an initial set of reusable assets, such as API fragments, API specs, templates, and more.
- Evangelize: In this step, the core C4E team will need to promote and evangelize C4E across the organization. After all, the principles of reuse and self-service that a C4E promotes won’t mean much if the organization doesn’t know about or use them.
- Drive asset consumption: Once a C4E becomes common knowledge across the organization, the C4E core team’s next job is to encourage and drive consumption of reusable assets. This can be done in various ways from onboarding and enabling project teams to encouraging dialogue among teams and incentivizing reuse through KPIs.

## Operating model of your CoE

"Centralized infrastructure and federated delivery"

### Centralization vs. federalization

- A CoE requires some level of centralization
  - Allows to reuse experiences and know-how accross the firm
  - Efficient as the people know what they are doing
  - Economy of scale
  - Governance
  - See also: https://theprocessautomationpulse.substack.com/p/a73
- But
  - Can become a bottleneck

### Implementing vs. enabling

- I started to differentiate this aspect, as most often, CoE's are centralized, but focus on enabling, while the implementation is done decentralized
- Central development can be a starting point, especially for the first 1-5 projects to also learn and build out your own best practices
- Then you should try to federate implementation, and the CEO's focus should become enabling
- Providing whatever is needed to do this

### Consultancy vs. providing software

- What changed over time is that is most often not only about providing expertise,
- But also providing self-service software as platform (PaaS/SaaS)

### Center of excellence vs. community of practice

- A community of practice is a loose community meeting regularly
- This is easier in organizations that value independence and decentral highly
- But the problem is typically the missing lack of focus/comittment of any of the participants
- There is also no clear DRI for a certain topic
- It is harder to have one person connecting loose ends or for example keep the connection to vendors or industry circles
- While it might work, we don't see pure community of practices in our most successful customers

## Aligning your CoE journey to the process orchestration maturity stages

- On level 1, you don't have a CoE yet, or the "to be CoE" implements the project
- On level 2, you typically don't have a CoE yet, or the "to be CoE" implements some of the projects to gain experience
- To get to level 3 and beyond, you need to build out your CoE. Typically people from the first projects should be at least involved, if not transferred, to that CoE to enable more teams to go into process orchestration projects

## CoE Anti Patterns

- CoE detached from challenges of automation teams on the ground
- CoEs provides too restrictive guidelines and become added bureaucracy
- Spend too much time with initiatives that don't generate value (e.g. architecture frameworks)
- No Authority & backing in the company
- No Management buy in and sufficient resources
- Lack of success tracking / KPIs
