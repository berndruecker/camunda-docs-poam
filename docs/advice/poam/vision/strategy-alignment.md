As a first step, the board-level vision for the organization around process automation needs to be clear.

## Examples

In the following list we share some typical visions, hopefully directly connected to measureable outcomes:

- Increase automation rate
  - by 20% for overall claim handling
- Be the company on the market delivering service X the fastest
  - e.g. opening up a new bank account in one minute completly online
- Delight the customer by an exceptional experience
  - Inform the customer about the exact status of their claim
- Cut costs (requiring more operational efficiency)
  - Don't backfill 50 retiring employees for claim handling, while increasing claim volume by 10%

Having clarity around those goals allows you to connect the benefits or porcess orchestration with this, for example:

- Increasing automation rate: Orchestrating your claims handling processes allows you to continously improve those processes and add more automation step-by-step. The clarity on how the process is automated even allows you to make more experiments around task automations, like for example leveraging AI.

- Shorter process cycle times: Orchestration makes sure, no instances get stuck between handoffs between humans or systems. At the same time, visibility on key metrics allow to discover bottlenecks and act on major weaknesses by adjusting the process.

- Improved customer experience:

- Cut costs:
